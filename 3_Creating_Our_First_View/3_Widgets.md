# Widgets

**Widgets** are the controls we'll use to create our views. The widgets we use in Android are **Native**. They are the same widgets you would use if you were building a traditional Android application. Most of the time we will use widgets by just adding them to our AXML files, but we can also create them dynamically by adding them in our activity logic. There are tons of Built-in Widgets but the ones we'll most commonly use are:

- Button
- TextView
- EditText
- Spinner
- Toolbar
- FAB (Floating Action Bar)
